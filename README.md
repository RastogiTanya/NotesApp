It’s a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t
forget anything important.
When you complete a task, you can delete it from your list.
This gives you a sense of progress and achievement.
If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving
forward.
